To start the website, first clone the repo in your system. Then open the folder in any code editor of your choice.

Use split terminal or open two terminal windows.

Use `cd webdpfrontend` to change your current working directory to the webdpfrontend directory in first terminal.

run the command `npm install`. This will download the node_modules folder and will install all the necessary dependencies required for the frontend part of website.

In another terminal use `cd webdpbackend` to change your current directory to the webdpbackend directory and run the command `npm install`. This will 
also download the node_modules and install the different dependencies required for the backend part.

After this is the same terminal run `node index.js`. This will start the database/server of the application which will fetch and post data in our database in mongodb atlas.

Then switch to webdpfrontend terminal and run `npm start` and boom you will be redirected to http://localhost:3000 which would be the login page of our website.
